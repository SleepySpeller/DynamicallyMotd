<br>Minecraft plugin for changing the server MOTD every time it gets pinged.

**Currently support is only guaranteed on versions 1.20 - 1.21.4**

# Functionality
DynamicallyMotd is a lightweight Spigot plugin which sends a random ***MOTD*** (**Message Of The Day**) every time it gets pinged.<br>
It takes the MOTD's directly from the plugin's config, which can be customized with custom MOTD's and MOTD colors.

I recommend using [MCTools MOTD Creator](https://mctools.org/motd-creator) for creating MOTD's. <br>
The plugin supports [Color and Format codes](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php) which are already covered by [MCTools MOTD Creator](https://mctools.org/motd-creator).
